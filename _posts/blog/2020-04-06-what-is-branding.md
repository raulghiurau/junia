### Your logo is only a piece of of what a brand really is.

Branding is the process of creating and managing a distinct identity and reputation for a company, product, service, or individual. It involves visual elements like logos and messaging that communicate values and uniqueness. 

Successful branding positions a brand in the market, delivers on promises, and creates a consistent and positive customer experience. It builds brand equity, fosters loyalty, and can lead to premium pricing. Consistency and ongoing management are essential for effective branding.
