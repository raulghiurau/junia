### 1. Makes sure they have experience in the marketing field.

One of the most important aspects to look for when searching for your next marketing consultant is if they have experience in the marketing field.

I have interviewed and researched a lot of marketing consulants and often times they see that its a good field to get into for a quick buck and say they can do everything thing. 

### 2. Ask them for previous work and results.

### 3. Inquire about a broad strategy to their approach.

### 4. Ask about a 30 - 60 - 90 day plan.

### 5. Always ask, what will I be looking to get from hiring you?
