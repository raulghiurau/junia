<p>A farmer plows his field, sows the seed, and fertilizes and cultivates-all the while knowing that in the final analysis he is utterly dependent on forces outside of himself. He knows he cannot cause the seed to germinate, nor can he produce the rain and sunshine for growing and harvesting the crop. For a successful harvest, he is dependent or these things from God. Yet the farmer knows that he diligently pursues his responsibilities to plow, plant, fertilize. and cultivate. He cannot expect a harvest at the end of the season. In a sense he is in a partnership with God, and he will reap the benefits only when he has fulfilled his own responsibilities.</p>

<p>Farming is a joint venture between God and the farmer. The farmer cannot do what God must do, and God will not do what the farmer should do.</p>
